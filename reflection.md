- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
It is time efficient since I don't have to repeat each line of codes when initializing a new instances by using super(). Inheritance gives me the option to customize methods and attributes for different subclasses. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
It was super interesting to realize that the parent class of Hashtable is Dictionary. This realization makes reading the Hashtable documentation easier and quicker to locate the relevant methods.
One thing I'm still unsure is when to throw and exception and when to sysout the error. Similarly, do I need to try catch every single line in main() or only for those lines where I'm expecting an error.
